Hands-On 3: Questions 1 - 6

1. For the given function we have (hypothesis: execution speed of each line is equal to 1 times n, which is the number it gets executed. Essentially c = 1)

        x=1; 		# 1
        for i=1:n	# n+1
            for j=1:n	# n(n+1)
                x=x+1;	# n^2
    The runtime would be calculated with the following summation formula:
    <br />
    $$T(n) = 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} 1$$
    $$\Rightarrow T(n) = 1 + (n+1) + n(n+1) + n^2$$
    $$\Rightarrow T(n) = 2n^2 + 2n + 2$$
2. Calculations table:
    
    | n     | T(n)      |
    |-------|-----------|
    | 1     | 6         |
    | 2     | 14        |
    | 3     | 26        |
    | 4     | 42        |
    | 5     | 62        |
    | 6     | 86        |
    | 7     | 114       |
    | 8     | 146       |
    | 9     | 182       |
    | 10    | 222       |
    | 100   | 20202     |
    | 1000  | 2002002   |
    | 10000 | 200020002 |

3. For this case, I pick c1 = ½ and c2 = 5, because: $\frac{1}{2} n^2 \leq 2n^2 + 3n + 2 \leq 5n^2$ (1)

    Αnd we derive the following notations:
    $$f(n) = O(n^2)$$
    $$f(n) = \Omega(n^2)$$
    $$f(n) = \Theta(n^2)$$

4. n_0 in our case is chosen to be equal to 2 since for any n ≥ 2, inequality (1) is valid<br />

    <br />As shown in the figure above, at x=1.4 the upper bound is larger than T(n), therefore, n_0=2 is the first integer that T(n) respects both bounds

5. In case the function changed as stated in the question: 
    x=1; 		# 1
    y=1;		# 1
        for i=1:n	# n+1
            for j=1:n	# n(n+1)
                x=x+1;		# n^2
                y=i+j;		# n^2

    The new T(n) would be:

    $$T(n) = 2 + \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} 1 + \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n+1} 1 + 2\sum_{i=1}^{n} \sum_{j=1}^{n} 1$$
    $$\Rightarrow T(n) = 2 + (n+1) + n(n+1) + 2n^2$$
    $$\Rightarrow T(n) = 3n^2 + 2n + 3$$

6. The results change as follows:
    
    |   n   |   T(n)    |
    |-------|-----------|
    |   1   |     8     |
    |   2   |     19    |
    |   3   |     36    |
    |   4   |     59    |
    |   5   |     88    |
    |   6   |     123   |
    |   7   |     164   |
    |   8   |     211   |
    |   9   |     264   |
    |  10   |     323   |
    | 100   |   30203   |
    | 1000  |  3002003  |
    | 10000 | 300020003 |

    In the low n’s there is a difference, but as n gets larger the difference to the first function is negligible.
